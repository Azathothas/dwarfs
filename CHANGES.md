# Change Log

## Version 0.2.3 - 2020-12-01

- Fix link handling. There were two bugs introduced with the
  new metadata format, one in file system creation and another
  in the fuse driver. You will have to re-create a file system
  created with dwarfs < 0.2.3 if it contained links. If you
  can absolutely not re-create the file system and the data
  is precious, let me know, there's actually a way to recover
  the missing data.


## Version 0.2.2 - 2020-11-30

- Remove read-only masking as it prevents writable overlays

- Throw an error in `mkdwarfs` if unrecognized command line
  arguments are encountered (github #5)
